Notes
^^^^^
If the orange juice is not particularly sweet, use 100-120ml

Pistachio can be replaced with almonds or hazelnuts

If rice flour is not available, use corn flour instead - probably not the same but it tasted fine when I tried

If some spices are not available, just keep cooking - it'll taste fine

Processing pistachio is by far the most expensive step of the recipe, get some friendly hands to help

Soup can also be blended using a manual masher or food processor
