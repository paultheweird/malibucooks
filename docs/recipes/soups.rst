Notes
^^^^^
If the orange juice is not particularly sweet, use 100-120ml
Pistachio can be replaced with almonds or hazelnuts
If rice flour is not available, use corn flour instead - probably not the same but it tasted fine when I tried
If some spices are not available, just keep cooking - it'll taste fine
Processing pistachio is by far the most expensive step of the recipe, get someone friendly hands to help
